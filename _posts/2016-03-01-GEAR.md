title: GEAR and Bridgekeepr Development
---

## Note

* They have their own docker setting file. So each have to run separately.
* Although they use the same EDEN SQL DB, they will create their own copy during testing.

## GEAR Quick Start


* Follow the Docker installation and configuration steps in the wiki.
* Bring service dependencies online with `docker-compose -f docker-dev.yml up -d`
* Verify that you have Node 4.4 and npm 2.x installed for local developement: `node --version; npm --version`
* Build and test the project: `npm install && npm run-script bower-install && npm run-script build`
* Start the service: `npm start`
* Test it out by visiting `http://localhost:9000` in your browser.

## GEAR Steps

* you may need to stop all EDEN related docker container by `docker-compose stop`
* restart docker default under GEAR directory
* `docker-machine restart default`
* `eval $(docker-machine env default --shell=bash)`
* `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d`
* the process will rebuild a new MySQL `docker_eden` db with needed tables
* `npm start` will start the service and you can start GEAR development
* note you may need to copy past any needed EDEN content

## BridgeKeepr Steps

* you may need to stop all EDEN related docker container by `docker-compose stop`
* restart docker default under bridgekeepr directory
* `docker-machine restart default`
* `eval $(docker-machine env default --shell=bash)`
* `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d`
* the process will rebuild a new MySQL `docker_eden` db with needed tables
* `./gradlew build` will build and test the service
* `./gradlew bootRun` will start the service
* Test it out by: `curl localhost:8080/health`
* note you may need to copy past any needed EDEN content 
* below is my bridgekeepr intelliJ project dev debug running profile
* below are my bridgekeepr postman GET/PATCH test settings
* in order to test PATCH, you need to use the JWTIO on the [project page](https://github.com/Source-Intelligence/bridgekeepr) to generate a `scope: Admin` test token.  The test token on the project page is for GET only.
