# 2019 QC

```
Please note that before CMRT V5, Q1 and Q2 answers are both required. 
Hence the logic related to it.  
After CMRT V5, if Q1 answers "NO", Q2 answer is not required.  
And Q1 answers "YES" combines with Q2 answers "NO" will have the same effect as Q1=NO && Q=NO pre CMRT V5.
```



### FLAG1:

A smelter has been provided for an unused metal

##### Hint:

Question 1 and 2 indicate no use of 3TG, but smelter name(s) or other information were provided.

##### Algorithm:

* (Q1 == NO) || (Q2 == NO) && (Smelter provided has metal) for CMRT V5
* (Q1 == NO) && (Q2 == NO) && (Smelter provided has metal) for CMRT V4
* First check if Q1 and Q2 have answers for CMRT V4.  If either one has no, we do not raise flag.  Return.
For CMRT V5, check if Q1 has answers or Q1 answers YES but Q2 has no answer.  If condition match, we do not raise flag.  Return.
* Then we use the query to get smelters provided from the response.

```
select smelter.*

from cmrt_smelter smelter

where smelter.response_id='383' and smelter.metal='GOLD';
```

* Then for CMRT V4, if Q1 answer is NO and Q2 answer is No and there are smelters back from the previous query, we raise the flag.  Return.
* For CMRT V5, if Q1 answer is NO or Q2 answer is No and there are smelters back from the previous query, we raise the flag.  Return.
* If none of the above, we do not raise flag.  Return.
 

###FLAG2:

No or invalid smelter has been provided for used metal

##### Hint:

Question 1 or 2 indicate the use of a covered metal, but either no smelter names were provided, or the names provided are not recognized as smelters.

##### Algorithm:

* (Q1 == YES OR Q2 == YES) && (No Smelter given OR Smelter given are Not Recognized)
* First check if Q1 and Q2 have answers.  If either one has no, we do not raise flag.  Return.
* Then we use the query to get smelters provided from the response:

```
select smelter.*
from cmrt_smelter smelter
where smelter.response_id='383' and smelter.metal='GOLD';
```

* Then we iterate the smelters result set to check if recognized by checking if the query count is greater than 0: (let us uses metal GOLD and smelter name : AngloGold Ashanti for our query example)
* We remember the smelter which has query count greater than zero in cmrt_qc_flag_cmrt_smelter_linker table for reference.

```
select count(*) 
from sr_smelter smelter
left join sr_smelter_status_lu smelterStatus on smelter.status=smelterStatus.id
left join sr_smelter_alias alias on smelter.id=alias.smelter_id
left join sr_smelter_detail detail on smelter.id=detail.smelter_id
left join sr_smelter_detail_status_lu detailStatus on detail.status=detailStatus.id
where 
smelterStatus.status = 'ACTIVE'
and detail.metal = 'GOLD'
and detail.type in ('exclusive_recycler','processor_smelter','refiner','recycler')
and detailStatus.status='VALID'
and (smelter.name='AngloGold Ashanti' || (alias.known_alias='AngloGold Ashanti' && alias.status = '1') );
```


* Then if (Q1 answers YES or Q2 answers YES) and (no smelters back from previous query or at least one smelter back from the previous query is not recognized), we raise the flag.  Return.
* Then if none of the above, we do not raise flag.  Return.
 

### FLAG3:

Indication of DRC sourcing

##### Hint:

Indication of DRC sourcing.

##### Algorithm:

* (Q3 == YES) OR (has known smelter from DRC)
* First check if Q1 and Q2 answers are both No?  If both No, we do not raise flag.  Return.
* Then if Q3 has no answer, we do not raise flag.  Return.
* Then we use the query to get smelters provided from the response:

```
select smelter.*
from cmrt_smelter smelter
where smelter.response_id='383' and smelter.metal='GOLD';
```

* Then we iterate the smelters result set to check if the smelter is identified from DRC.   If a list of smelters provided, even one from DRC qualify this check.  
* Please note the DRC country will be identified by RISK_LEVEL = '3' in the country risk table.
* We remember the smelter which has query count greater than zero in cmrt_qc_flag_cmrt_smelter_linker table for reference.

```
select count(*) 
from sr_smelter smelter
left join sr_smelter_status_lu smelterStatus on smelter.status=smelterStatus.id
left join sr_smelter_alias alias on smelter.id=alias.smelter_id
left join sr_smelter_detail detail on smelter.id=detail.smelter_id
left join sr_smelter_detail_status_lu detailstatus on detail.status=detailstatus.id
left join sr_smelter_provider provider on smelter.id=provider.smelter_id
left join sr_smelter_provider_status_lu providerStatus on provider.status=providerStatus.id
left join sr_smelter_country_reserve_risk country on provider.country_id=country.id
where 
smelterStatus.status = 'ACTIVE'
and detail.metal = 'GOLD'
and detailstatus.status='VALID'
and detail.type in ('exclusive_recycler','processor_smelter','refiner','recycler')
and (smelter.name='A.L.M.T. Corp.' || (alias.known_alias='A.L.M.T. Corp.' && alias.status = '1') )
and providerStatus.status = 'VALID'
and country.risk_level='3';
```

* Then if Q3 answers YES and even one smelter from DRC, we raise the flag.  Return.
* Then if none from above, we do not raise flag.  Return.
 

### FLAG4:

Indicate DRC sourcing without matching smelter information

##### Hint:

Question 3 indicates sourcing from a Covered Country, but none of the smelters listed are known to source from one of these countries. 

##### Algorithm:

* (Q3 == Yes) && (no known Smelter from DRC was provided)
* First check if Q1 and Q2 answers are both No?  If both No, we do not raise flag.  Return.
* Then check if Q3 has answer?  If not, do not raise flag.  Return.
* Then we use the query to get smelters provided from this response:

```
select smelter.*
from cmrt_smelter smelter
where smelter.response_id='383' and smelter.metal='GOLD';
```

* Then we iterate the smelters list to verify if identified from DRC?
* Please note the DRC country will be identified by RISK_LEVEL = '3' in the country risk table.
* We remember the smelter which has query count greater than zero in cmrt_qc_flag_cmrt_smelter_linker table for reference.

```
select count(*) 
from sr_smelter smelter
left join sr_smelter_status_lu smelterStatus on smelter.status=smelterStatus.id
left join sr_smelter_alias alias on smelter.id=alias.smelter_id
left join sr_smelter_detail detail on smelter.id=detail.smelter_id
left join sr_smelter_detail_status_lu detailstatus on detail.status=detailstatus.id
left join sr_smelter_provider provider on smelter.id=provider.smelter_id
left join sr_smelter_provider_status_lu providerStatus on provider.status=providerStatus.id
left join sr_smelter_country_reserve_risk country on provider.country_id=country.id
where 
smelterStatus.status = 'ACTIVE'
and detail.metal = 'GOLD'
and detailstatus.status='Known'
and detail.type in ('exclusive_recycler','processor_smelter','refiner','recycler')
and (smelter.name='A.L.M.T. Corp.' || (alias.known_alias='A.L.M.T. Corp.' && alias.status = '1') )
and providerStatus.status = 'VALID'
and country.risk_level='3';
```
 

* If more than one smelter provided, they all need to be not from DRC in order for the flag to be raised.
* Then if Q3 answers YES and no one smelter from DRC from previous query, we raise the flag.  Return.
* If none of the above, we do not raise flag.  Return.
 

### FLAG5:

Less than 100% of sourcing information has been collected

##### Hint:

Question 5 indicates that all the necessary information from suppliers who provide materials that contain 3TG has not been collected; additional information about sourcing collection efforts is needed.

##### Algorithm:

* (Q5 != YES)
* First check if Q1 and Q2 answers are both No?  If both No, we do not raise flag.  Return.
* Then check if Q5 has answer?  If not, do not raise flag.  Return.
* If Q5 answers not equals to yes, raise flag.  Return.
* If noe of the above, do not raise flag.  Return.
 

### FLAG6:

All smelters have not been identified

##### Hint:

Question 6 indicates that all of the necessary information regarding smelters in the supply chain has not been collected; additional information about smelter collection efforts is needed.

##### Algorithm:

(Q6 != YES)
First check if Q1 and Q2 answers are both No?  If both No, we do not raise flag. Return.
Then check if Q6 has answer?  If no answer, do not raise flag.  Return.
Then check if Q6 answers not equals to yes?  If yes, raise the flag.  Return.
If none of the above, do not raise flag.  Return.
 

###FLAG7:

All smelter information has not been reported

##### Hint:

Question 7 indicates that not all smelter information received by your company has been reported; additional information about why information was not shared is needed. 

##### Algorithm:

* (Q7 != YES)
* First check if Q1 and Q2 answers are both No? If both No, we do not raise flag. Return.
* Then we check if Q7 been answered.  If not answered, do not raise flag.  Return.
* Then we check if Q7 been answered, and answer does not equal to YES, we raise flag.  Return.
* If none above, we do not raise flag.  Return.
 

### FLAG8:

Indicate 100% recycle/scrap, without matching smelter information

##### Hint:

Question 4 indicates 100% of necessary 3TG originates from smelters that are exclusive recyclers, but one or more smelters listed are not known to be exclusive recyclers.

##### Algorithm:

* (Q4 == Yes) && (Not All SOR Use Recycle)
* If answer to q1 and q2 for the metal are both no, we do not raise the flag.  Return.
* Then if no answer to q4, we do not raise the flag.  Return.
* Then we use the query to get smelters provided for this response:

```
select smelter.*

from cmrt_smelter smelter

where smelter.response_id='383' and smelter.metal='GOLD';
```

* We iterate through the smelter list get back to check if the smelter is recycler. If any one is not recycler, qualified the check.

```
select count(*)
from sr_smelter smelter
left join sr_smelter_status_lu smelterStatus on smelter.status=smelterStatus.id
left join sr_smelter_alias alias on smelter.id=alias.smelter_id
left join sr_smelter_detail detail on smelter.id=detail.smelter_id
left join sr_smelter_detail_status_lu detailstatus on detail.status=detailstatus.id
where smelterStatus.status = 'ACTIVE'
and detail.metal = 'GOLD'
and detailstatus.status='VALID'
and (smelter.name='A.L.M.T. Corp.' || (alias.known_alias='A.L.M.T. Corp.' && alias.status = '1') )
and detail.type = 'EXCLUSIVE_RECYCLER'
and detail.value = '1'
and detailStatus.status='VALID'
```

* So if q4 answers yes and previous check qualifies, we raise the flag.  Return.
* Then if q4 answers yes and no smelter provided from the response, we raise the flag.  Return.
* If none of above, we do not raise flag.  Return.
