title: How I test LimeSurvey submssion
---

* PM create survey within Limesurvey
    * Limesurvey is in Docker container now.
    * use `docker-compose ps` to get your docker limesurvey ip     
    * on DEV1, `https://dev-svc-1-survey.sourceintelligence.net/admin/` adn admin and regular admin paswd.
    * on your local, `http://boot2docker:8001/admin`. You can update the admin id email and paswd in `docker_ls2` table.
    * use this command to copy dev1 mongo eden content to your local computer, then you can load it into your docker mongo or whatever. `docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/dump:/root/dump docker.sourceintelligence.net/mongo:2.6 mongodump --host dev-1.node.us-west-2.s44 --db docker_eden` You have to run it under docker environment of course, for example the environment you start up the container.
    * use `bsondump collection.bson > collection.json` to convert the download to json if you need.  You need to have local mongo installation to have bsondump.
* PM give a spreadsheet of survey field definition with score definition to Mike. You can ask either Mike or Broke to get a copy of that spreadsheet.
* Mike enters them (using ECHO script) to EDEN DB, especially score definitions.  `survey2_*` tables. Mike run command (ECHO) to import the survey from limesurvey to mongo and EDEN DB. These are the survey2_* tables in EDEN db.
    * do `docker exec -it dev1_echo_1 /bin/bash` to switch your self to echo container
    * do `curl localhost:8080/survey` to display a list of available APIs
    * the one we need is `localhost:8080/survey/provider/{customerCompanyId}/{providerName whihc is LS2}/{providerId which is the survey id}`, then data will be ported into EDEN survey2_* tables.
    * For self_assessment fields, not sure we will update the ECHO script or we can manually update the DB content. ECHO PR #241 would explain the self assessment fields.    
* User filled in survey, after submittion, Limesurvey store data in its own DB, ECHO put all data in Mongo, some definition in EDEN. `survey2_*` tables.
* When customer go to EDEN Intelligence page, survey result can be view there with score.
* When the survey page loaded there, EDEN calls ECHO to pull data from Mongo and calculate score on the fly based on score definition in EDEN db. Score data not saved, just calculated for display and export purpose.

## BEFORE 2017
--

## Install Our Modified LimeSurvey
* Get the source from [our github](https://github.com/Source-Intelligence/LimeSurvey)
* I copy the whole source structure under //EDEN/sf2/web so I can keep using my localhost url without setting vhost.  You can choose your own setup.
* go to http://localhost/limesurvey/admin and follow the onscreen instruction to create a DB in your local MySQL server.  I used the name `limesurvey3` and you can use anything of your own. After completion, you will have a blank DB created in your local MySQL server.
* if you want to copy prod data, you can.  Just make sure to modify the follwoing.
    * you may want to keep your own `lime_users` record if you do not know prod user password. just make sure to update the uid in other tables for example `owner_id` in table `lime_surveys`     
    * `adminemail`, `bounce_email` value in the table `lime_survey`
    * `email` value in the table `lime_users` in case email send out to the world
    * `surveyls_url` in table `lime_surveys_languagesettings`. this is the end of survey auto forward url address. change to match your testing vhost.  For my own test, I use the value `http://localhost/app_dev.php/sourcelink/task/support/survey/end?token={TOKEN}`
    * these are minimum needed tables:
        * `lime_question_attributes`
        * `lime_questions`
        * `lime_groups`
        * `lime_surveys`
        * `lime_surveys_languagesettings`
        * `lime_survey_{survey-id}`
        * `lime_tokens_{survey-id}`
        * `lime_users`
* under EDEN parameters.yml here the changed value to match my directory and db setting:

```
        lime_survey2.database_driver: pdo_mysql
        lime_survey2.database_host: 127.0.0.1
        lime_survey2.database_port:
        lime_survey2.database_name: limesurvey3
        lime_survey2.database_user: s44admin
        lime_survey2.database_password: test
        lime_survey2.base_url: http://localhost/limesurvey
        lime_survey2.rpc_user:
        lime_survey2.rpc_password:
        lime_survey2.getdoc_baseurl:

        # Additional Lime Survey parameters
        lime_survey.getdoc_baseurl: http://localhost/limesurvey/s44_custom/getdoc.php
```



## Mongo DB
* you need to have local mongo db running. if not, please refer to installation note in a different docuemnt to install it
* and you need rockmongo as admin UI or any other tools you are familiar with
* on my computer, I use `local` as the name of DB (you can use whatever name) and setup your parameters.yml

```
        # MongoDB settings
        mongodb.database_name: local
        mongodb.connection.server: mongodb://localhost:27017
        mongodb.connection.options: { connect: true }

        # MongoDB session storage
        session.storage_handler.mongodb.server: mongodb://localhost:27017
        session.storage_handler.mongodb.options: { connect: true }
```

* create a table name `task_flow`
* I insert the following value for my test. change the values for your LS test.

```
    {
      "_id": ObjectId("53eb995504e835a603b938de"),
      "comment": "Macy's 2014 Trim Survey",
      "name": "Macy's 2014 Trim Survey",
      "steps": [
        {
          "name": "survey",
          "initParams": {
            "surveyId": 92662
          }
        }
      ]
    }
```
    
* the surveyId is the id from limesurvey db for the survey you want to test
* the objectid value will match the `flow_id` value in table `task_campaign`
* you will be able to find an existing survey name you want to test in `task_campaign` table
* make sure you update the `company_id` value in table `task` linked by `campaign_id` to match your testing login user's company
    
    
## Testing (make sure you use your own survey url)

* you updated the `company_id` in table `task` for your testing login user's company
* update `state_current_step` to `survey` and `state_completed_steps_json` to `[]` and `state_compelted_at` to null and `first_compelted_at` to null.
* you need to login as `role_social_admin`
* if the survey has already been submitted, go to table `lime_survey_result` and look for `task_id` to match your test, set `compelted_at` to null. please use null instead of blank.
* go to limesurvey db, update table `lime_tokens_74785` that the number is the survey number, set `usesleft` to `1` and `compelted` to `N`
* go to limesurvey db, update table `lime_surveys_language` for survey id is 74785, set `surveyls_url` to `http://localhost/app_dev.php/sourcelink/task/support/survey/end?token={TOKEN}`
* now you login and go to `http://localhost/app_dev.php/sourcelink/profile#tasks`, the task will be available for you to fillout.

## Example
* now let's say I want to test "2014 Conflict Minerals Policy Upload" limesurvey.
* I go to EDEN `task_campaign` table look for name contains "2014 Conflict Minerals Policy Upload" and I find record with id 330 and 331.
* I then go to EDEN `task` table and look for `campaign_id` equals 330 or 331.
* I find many. then I filter by company_id=1
* I pick randonly record id=82782 for my test.
* set this record `state_current_step` to "survey" and `state_compelted_steps` to "[]" and reset `state_comeplted_at` and `first_comeplted_at` value to NULL.
* go to EDEN `lime_survey_result` table to search if any record has `task_id` equal to 82782.
* I find one, then set the `completed_at` value to NULL.
* from this record, I know the survey id is 67574 and token is e3f18f0ab3174b27978a11be77d57067. these values should match values in limesurvey db.
* now you need an entry in mongo db under the task flow as follows.

```
    {
      "_id": ObjectId("542c64e204e835f22ce58d04"),
      "comment": "Macy's 2014 Conflict Minerals Policy Acknowledgement",
      "name": "Macy's 2014 Conflict Minerals Policy Acknowledgement",
      "steps": [
        {
          "name": "survey",
          "initParams": {
            "surveyId": 74785
          }
        }
      ]
    }
```

* at this moment, refresh `http://localhost/app_dev.php/sourcelink/profile#tasks` this survey task should be listed under Active Reqeusts section and GO button appears.
* now I copy PROD limesurevey table `lime_survey_67574` and `lime_tokens_76574` to my local limesurvey db.
* I go to my local `lime_tokens_67574` and look for token=e3f18f0ab3174b27978a11be77d57067 record. then I update this record `compelted` to "N" and `usedleft` to "1".
* Now I am ready to go back to `http://localhost/app_dev.php/sourcelink/profile#tasks` and click on the GO button to test the survey.


##Here are a survey high level algorithm
* When you login EDEN and if a lime survey is waiting for you, you click and go to for example: http://localhost/app_dev.php/sourcelink/task/support/campaign/4cbb8338-1a14-402f-abb5-513729e5caa1/participate
* Then EDEN will forward you to http://localhost/app_dev.php/sourcelink/task/cm-data/370d7c72-2442-4aa9-b5c7-b0f2b2e992b7
* This page will show you some some survey reason and you can click to enter the lime survey.
* Then EDEN will forward you to lime for eample: https://survey2.sourceintelligence.net/92662?token=d2c2fbeef18d43b6a18eead80cb56055
* After you complete the survey and click submit, lime will forward you to http://localhost/app_dev.php/sourcelink/task/support/survey/end?token=370d7c72-2442-4aa9-b5c7-b0f2b2e992b7 This is defined in lime `lime_surveys_languagesettings` table.
* EDEN will then update couple db content, then forward user again for example to http://localhost/app_dev.php/sourcelink/task/cm-data/370d7c72-2442-4aa9-b5c7-b0f2b2e992b7
* Now this page will display a different content than above mentioned (you noticed this URL appears previously, right?).  
* It will show you survey already completed.
* Two important piece of codes:
* TaskControllerListener.assertTaskAccessibility() to check if continue loading the task or not.
* ProfileRequestsController.openRequestsDataTable() to show the Active Reqeusts Section listing.
