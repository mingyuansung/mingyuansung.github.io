**installation note**  

* Install PHP mongo driver manually if you do not want the latest version using Macport.  http://www.w3resource.com/mongodb/install-php-driver.php
* Use port 23 for access s44-buildbox-1 to download SQL backup file.  If not specify port, the connection will go t port 70 or 22 and time out.
* After install less, need to configure the node_module location path in the parameter yml file.  Mine is Node_paths: [/opt/local/lib/node_modules]
* If ‘sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management’ fails complaining about enlarge.cookie file access, do ‘chmod 600 .erlang.cookie’ should resolve it.
* Rabbitmq needs an earlier erlang install since it does not recognize erlang v17.  So ‘sudo port uninstall erlang’ first, then go to https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp and pick maybe R16B03, download the dmg installation package and install it.
* Download from http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-generic-unix.html and untar the file, move to /usr/local directory.
* Do a ‘sudo sbin/rabbitmq-server’ to start the server, then use your browser to go to http://localhost:15672/ then login using guest/guest to confirm your installation.
* User can install mongodb via homebrew
* install RockMongo - http://rockmongo.com/wiki/installation?lang=en_us
* for the php mongo extension issue I have.  I went to http://www.w3resource.com/mongodb/install-php-driver.php and download the v1.4.5 driver source.  Follow the manual installation process, compiled the source and installed it manually.  Then I can install vendors now. 
* run app/console cache:clear
